<h2 id="initialisation">Initialisation</h2>
<p>Before one can use the automatic join functions, initialisation has to occur so that:</p>
<ul>
<li>A connection to the SQL Database is established</li>
<li>The &quot;db_fields&quot; Dataframe is returned so that the user can select which columns they want to include.
The whole process revolves around the db_fields DF, which can be configured by the user in a user-friendly way using mouse clicks to select SQL fields.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-r">library(dbautojoinr)

#If the file exists, it's read and the db_fields object is created by it.
#If it doesn't, then it's created with every field included, with potentially IDs and FKs excluded, depending on what you select

<p>Depending on what you want to achieve, there are different levels of joining that you might want to do.</p>
<ul>
<li>Level 1 (<strong>main_joint_tables</strong>): All tables with foreign keys are joined with all the tables they have a relationship with (unless said tables have all their fields as INCLUDE == FALSE by the user)</li>
<li>Level 2 (<strong>joint_table_Without_extended_joins</strong>): Join the tables of main_joint_tables into 1 complete table. This will bring the row level of the 1-Joint-Table to the row level of the 1st table of the LHS declared on db_forced_rel</li>
<li>Level 3 (<strong>extended_main_joint_tables</strong>): Some of the Main joint tables might need to be joined by other Main joint tables because a table may hold information that has different meaning depending on which table it's joint with (see explanation in more detail below at the comments on 'Getting the extended_main_joint_tables' section)</li>
<li>Level 4 (<strong>joint_table_With_extended_joins</strong>) Join the tables of extended_main_joint_tables into 1 complete table. This will bring the row level of the 1-Joint-Table to the row level of the 1st table of the LHS declared on db_forced_rel</li>

<h4 id="create-and-populate-the-database">1. Create and populate the Database</h4>
<p>Copy the SQL code under the <a href="https://github.com/N1h1l1sT/dbautojoinr/tree/master/SQL">&quot;SQL folder&quot;</a> of the package into SSMS and execute the Query.
First execute <em>Database Creation.sql</em> and then execute <em>Data Population.sql</em>.
Now you have a &quot;dbautojoinr&quot; SQL Database on your SQL Server with 4 tables (DIM_Employee, DIM_Region, DIM_Site, and FACT_Hours) and with data populated on those tables.
The SQL Relationships also already exist on your SQL Database, so you won't need to explicitly impose them on the Initialisation code.</p>

<p>You've probably noticed that instead of using <code>create_extended_main_joint_tables</code> to get the result, we're now using 2 different functions that each performs 1 step.
The 1st one (<code>CreateMainJointTables</code>) will retrieve the Main Tables, whilst the 2nd (<code>CreateExtendedMainJointTables</code>) does the extended joins (in our case, it joins <code>main_joint_tables[[DIM_Employee]].[MainSite_ID]</code> with <code>[DIM_Site].[Site_ID]</code> )
Now, you might want to proceed with this long way if you want to also make custom transformations to some table before the next joining level occurs.
<strong>Be careful with DeselectKeysIfIncludeFalse which must always be FALSE prior to the last level and always TRUE at the last one.</strong></p>
